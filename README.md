# Browser Agent

This is a simple browser agent that can be used to automate web browsing tasks. It uses the Playwright library to control a web browser and perform actions such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and navigating to different pages.

Current version is only giving instructions to the user. The next version will be able to perform actions in the browser.

Inspired by [BrowserUse](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) work.
